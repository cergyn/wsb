# Instructions
First, install the packages by typing "**npm init && npm install**".  
Edit your **/etc/hosts** file and add "**127.0.0.1 wsb**" for the name resolution.  
Open the terminal and type "**node .**" to run the server.  
Go to "http://wsb:8501"  
Now you can test the allow/block functionality from the BG popup (turn on/off the ad blocking).  
You should see a cat typing like crazy if adblock is turned off
